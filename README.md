I used ChatGPT to help create my site SynchroniCity. It was very helpful and it broke down the process in easy to follow steps. It is a lot of fun to create new applications. I know that the site is not polished but I am sure with more practice using AI, it would look much better. AI is able to explain concepts quickly and plainly which saves time on tasks that are repetitive.  It offers a very hands-on approach by learning and doing simultaneously and adapts to my pace. I noticed that the more detail I offered, the better the results. It allows even novices like me to become proficient. It enhances the creative process by offering different ideas/perspectives.
